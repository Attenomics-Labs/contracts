 * @title SelfTokenVault
 * @notice Holds the creator's tokens (x%) until they are withdrawn.
 *         Tokens are vested according to a configurable scheduleâ€”similar

 *         to vesting: after an initial lock period (lockTime), every dripInterval
 *         a fixed percentage (dripPercentage) of the locked tokens is released.
 *
 *         The remaining tokens (100 - lockedPercentage) are available immediately.
 *
 *         For correct vesting calculations, the owner (creator) must call initialize()
 *         once tokens have been minted to the vault.
